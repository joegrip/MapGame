# MapGame
A map game written in Swift for MacOS

TODO: Make work with multiple units

Melee: Lots of health and damage but slow
Ranged: Slow but ranged attack. Need more range
Horse: Fast and devastating to ranged


Features:
	Select Unit see window at side
	Each unit can only attack once per turn

Balance:
	Cannons have more range
	Add defense stat
	Maybe flanking manu
	General Unit

Idea: Ranged wins games. Melee and Horse are there to attack and defend ranged
