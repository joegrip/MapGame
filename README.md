# MapGame
A map game written in Swift for MacOS

TODO: Make work with multiple units

Melee: Lots of health and damage but slow
Ranged: Slow but ranged attack. Need more range
Horse: Fast and devastating to ranged


Features:
	Select Unit see window at side
	Each unit can only attack once per turn
	Some dead tiles. Randomly placed in center. Can't go through. Board may not be big enough

Bugs:
	Ranged color must be exactly red
	Should probably gives tiles own class with move select and ranged select vars

Balance:
	Add defense stat
	Maybe flanking manu
	General Unit

Idea: Ranged wins games. Melee and Horse are there to attack and defend ranged
